# CSES-Psets
CSES problem set solutions. 
CSES does not accept submission for vanilla javascript.
All solutions in vanilla js can only be used and tested locally, but not submitted. They will fail the tests.
I will include sample unit tests for all vanilla js solutions that cover as many use cases as possible.
All solutions in other languages will be submission ready.
